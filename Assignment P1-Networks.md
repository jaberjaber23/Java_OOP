**Assignment 1**

**Network**: it is any collection of independent computers that exchange
information with each other over a shared communication medium, there
are many types like:

1)  **Local Area Networks**: it is usually confined to a limited
    geographic area. LANs can be small, linking as few as three
    computers, but can often link hundreds of computers used by
    thousands of people, Such as:

<!-- end list -->

  - Single building

  - College campus

**<span class="smallcaps">Types of LANs:</span>**

  - Peer-to-peer

  - Client/server

**<span class="smallcaps">The benefit of LANs:</span>**

  - The device can use a single internet connection

  - Share files with one another

  - Print to shared printers

  - Be accessed and even controlled by one another

**<span class="smallcaps">the line comprises:</span>**

Cables, access points, switches, routers, web servers, and other LANs
via wide area networks.

**<span class="smallcaps">Advantages:</span>**

  - Simple and relatively inexpensive

  - Collaboration of resources

  - The association involving client and server

**<span class="smallcaps">Disadvantages:</span>**

  - The information security issue that arises

  - Long-distance major limitation

  - All advices may be disproportionately

2)  **Wide Area Network**: it is a collection of LANs or another network
    that communicates with one other. A WAN is essentially a network of
    networks, with the internet the world’s largest WAN.

**<span class="smallcaps">Type of WANs:</span>**

  - TCP/IP protocol suite

  - Packet over SONET/SDH(PoS)

  - A network of bank cash

**<span class="smallcaps">Advantage of WANs:</span>**

  - WAN can cover most areas

  - You can save everything on this network

  - This network has high bandwidth

**<span class="smallcaps">The disadvantage of WANs:</span>**

  - Installation costs

  - Disconnection problems

**<span class="smallcaps">Advantages of WAN:</span>**

  - Area coverage

  - Centralized data

  - Increased bandwidth

**<span class="smallcaps">Disadvantages of WAN:</span>**

  - Need of security solutions

  - Installation costs

  - Troubleshooting issues

3)  **Controller Area Network**: it is a network technology that
    provides fast communication among microcontrollers up to real-time
    requirements, eliminating the need for the much more expensive and
    complex technology of Dual-Ported RAM.

**<span class="smallcaps">The benefit of CANs:</span>**

  - Low-Cost

  - Lightweight Network

**<span class="smallcaps">CANs applications:</span>**

  - Automotive industry

  - Medical equipment manufacturers

**<span class="smallcaps">Advantages of CAN:</span>**

  - It is a fast way of communication between microcontrollers and
    devices

  - The data transfer rate is about 1 Mbps

**<span class="smallcaps">Disadvantages of CAN:</span>**

  - Due to different voltage levels

  - The nodes communication in an undesirable fashion

4)  **Metropolitan Area Network**: it is a computer network that
    connects computers within a metropolitan area. A MAN is large than
    LAN but smaller than WAN.

> **<span class="smallcaps">Example of MAN:</span>**

  - Cable TV network

  - Telephone network providing high-speed DSL lines

**<span class="smallcaps">Advantages of MAN:</span>**

  - It requires fewer resources compare to WAN

  - It helps people interface fast LANs together

  - It help in cost effective sharing of common resources such as
    printers

**<span class="smallcaps">Disadvantages of MAN:</span>**

  - It is difficult to manage the network once it becomes large

  - It is difficult to make the system secure from hack and industrial
    espionage

  - Network installation requires skilled technicians and network
    administrators

5)  **Personal Area Network**: it is connecting electronic devices
    within a user’s immediate area. The size of a PAN ranges from a few
    centimeters to a few meters. PAN can connect laptops, tablets,
    printers, keyboards, and other computerized devices.

\* A PAN Network Connection can either be
<span class="underline">wired</span> or
<span class="underline">wireless</span>:

**<span class="smallcaps">Wired connection method:</span>**

  - USB

  - FireWire

**<span class="smallcaps">Wireless connection methods:</span>**

  - Wi-Fi

  - IrDA

  - Zigbee

**<span class="smallcaps">Advantages of PAN:</span>**

  - In PAN no extra space requires

  - Connect to many devices at a time

  - Affordable cost

**<span class="smallcaps">Disadvantages of PAN:</span>**

  - Pan can be operated in less range of areas

  - Can only be used for personal area

  - Interfere with radio signals
